        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello everyone, welcome to my portfolio.
             I'm Gunjan Pandey, a student pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Graphic Era Hill University. 
             I am currently in my 5th semester, and I'm delighted to share that I have successfully completed two projects. 
             I'm also actively looking for an internship opportunity to further develop my skills and gain practical experience in the field of computer science.
        </p>
        <p1>
            In addition to my project work, I have honed a range of technical skills, 
            including proficiency in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++.
             I'm also well-versed in web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
             My passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to explore various aspects of computer science and develop a strong foundation in software development.
        </p1>
        <p2>
            Please explore my portfolio to learn more about my projects and technical skills. 
            Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities to discuss. Thank you for visiting!

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <h3>Online Python Interpreter</h3>
            <p>An online Python interpreter project is a web-based platform that allows users to write, run, and test Python code directly from their web browsers. 
                It provides a convenient and accessible environment for coding in Python without the need for local installations. Users can enter Python code into a text editor, execute it, and see the results instantly. 
                These platforms often include features like code syntax highlighting and error checking, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced Python programmers to experiment with code, troubleshoot, and learn Python in an interactive way.</p>

            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <h3>File Encryption</h3>
            <p>A file encryption project is a software application or system designed to secure sensitive data by converting it into a format that can only be read or decoded with the appropriate decryption key. 
            This process, known as encryption, ensures that even if unauthorized individuals access the encrypted files, they cannot make sense of the data without the key.
            File encryption is essential for protecting confidential information, such as personal documents, financial records, or sensitive business data. It is commonly used in various fields, including cybersecurity, to ensure the privacy and security of digital information.
